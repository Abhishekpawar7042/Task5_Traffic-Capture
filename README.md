#Objective
Capture and analyze live network traffic to identify common protocols.

#Steps Performed

3. Stopped capture and filtered by protocol (HTTP, DNS, TCP).

#Protocols Observed
- DNS: Used for domain name resolution.
- TCP: Reliable transport protocol.
- HTTP: Web data transfer.

#Outcome
Gained understanding of how network packets travel and how to inspect them using Wireshark.
